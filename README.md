Synopsis: While the media often overlooks school gun violenc in relation to gang presence—such as targeted attacks and drive-by shootings—I will examine how this environmental mechanism of of Chicago gangs contributes to elevated rates of gun violence, crime, and school gun violence in Chicago. Although, this study focuses on the less-publicized, smaller-scale school gun violence
incidents, I explore a socialization framework and Gun Violence Intervention Model (GVIM) to examine how school gun violence manifests
from environmental mechanisms. These mechanisms—often overlooked in earlier work—are
community-specific and, I propose, closely tied to gang presence.....At the core of this research is the idea that gun violence, especially in schools, is not just
random. Gang
territories act like invisible borders in the city. I argue that schools are shaped
by their social environments, and gang-influenced areas are often overlooked in mainstream media but are vital for
understanding everyday gun and crime threats some students in schools face.

The Point wise Conditional Intensity (x) of Gun Violence Incidents in Chicago
(2007–2024)(excluding the year 2013). The intensity function reflects the estimated risk of shootings, with higher
concentrations near the South and West Sides. With gang boundaries used as a covariate in the IPPP model, these regions are in line with prevalent intersecting gang terrritories and experience the greatest likely hood of school gun violence cases. Gang territories was studied from 2007- 2024 based on the availability of Gang territory data

A promising direction for future research includes: uncovering how specific aspects of gang activity internally (eg. gun distribution, drug trafficking, and initiation) escalate the likelihood of violence; identifying the most effective methods for determining whether gang presence typically precedes school gun violence; and analyzing what proportion of school gun violence cases are more attributable to gang dynamics versus broader gun-related issues."
