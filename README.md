Synopsis: While the media often overlooks school gun violenc in relation to gang presence—such as targeted attacks and drive-by shootings—I will examine how this environmental mechanism of of Chicago gangs contributes to elevated rates of gun violence, crime, and school gun violence in Chicago. Although, this study focuses on the less-publicized, smaller-scale school gun violence
incidents, I explore a socialization1framework and Gun Violence Intervention Model (GVIM) to examine how school gun violence manifests
from environmental mechanisms. These mechanisms—often overlooked in earlier work—are
community-specific and, I propose, closely tied to gang presence.
